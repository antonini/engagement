INTRO

        cOALA

A long time ago
in a galaxy far far away.

It is a period of terrible code.
Mixed indentations and bad standards
are making code unmaintainable
and have overpowered codebases in all starsystems.

--------------------

INTERVIEW/UDAYAN (morphed, sound from interview):

When I first met Udayan, his coding style was bad.
(UDAYAN BAD CODE)
And when I say bad, I mean like, really bad.
(END OF UDAYAN BAD CODE)
Well, I guess at some point he couldn't stand it anymore.

--------------------

UDAYAN:

(Laptop throwing scene) (Fuck you!)

--------------------

INTERVIEW:

Yeah, he was really pissed.

Little did he know,

--------------------

UDAYAN/INTERVIEW:

(UDAYAN)
(Throw coala cola can to him, he catches it)

(INTERVIEW, parallel, sound only)
but we were working on a tool,
that would change his life forever.

--------------------

UDAYAN:

(Close up on coala showing the patch)
(Drinks from coala can)

--------------------

INTERVIEW:

Equipped with coala, Udayan was able to take the war to the bugs.

Cheers!

--------------------

UDAYAN:

I don't where you are.
I don't know why you're here.

I can tell you, I don't have a lot of patience.
But what I have is a particular set of tools.

Tools I have acquired over a large number of commits.
Tools that make me a nightmare for bugs like you.

I will look for you,
I will find you
and I will fix you.

TEXT:

No coala's were hurt during the making of that movie.
